subtitle: In god we trust. All others must bring data. - W. E. Deming

Hi, my name is Gabriel Lages and Data Science is my passion. I've been spending the better part of my professional life helping companies make decisions based on Data Analysis.

Since 2015 I've been working at [Hotmart](http://www.hotmart.com) one of the most important Brazilian's Startup (I know that after 350 employees maybe we aren't a Startup anymore but we really love the Startup's mindset). In past years I had the opportunity to work in different areas like Marketing, Pricing, Product, Business Intelligence and Data Science. Today I'm the manager of the Data Science & Analytics team.

In 2018 I founded a Data Science Community - [Data Hackers](http://www.datahackers.com.br) - with two other friends, and in less than one year it became the biggest Data Science Community in Brazil, we also have a [Podcast](https://anchor.fm/datahackers), a [Slack Channel](https://slack-datahackers-invitation.herokuapp.com/) and a [Medium website](https://medium.com/data-hackers). 
*Ps: All the content are in Portuguese.
