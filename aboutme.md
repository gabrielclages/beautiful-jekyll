Hi, my name is Gabriel Lages and Data Science is my passion. I've been spending the better part of my professional life helping companies make decisions based on Data Analysis.

Since 2015 I've been working at [Hotmart](http://www.hotmart.com) one of the most important Brazilian's Startup. In past years I had the opportunity to work in different areas like Marketing, Product and BI. Today I'm the manager of the Business Intelligence & Analytics team.

- `R`, `Python` and `Excel`

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
